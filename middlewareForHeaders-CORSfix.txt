This is some middleware that can be placed in our main.js of our express files, to ensure that when we make a angular request to our local host, the browser will accept the request.

This is to bypas the CORS security feature of the browser and communicate through our headers that it's okay to take our request. CORS stands for corss-origin resource sharing.
